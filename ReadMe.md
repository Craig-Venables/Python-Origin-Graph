# Python-Origin-Graph:

This is a simple script to run through a given directory of text files and plot the corresponding graphs; <br />
Iv, Log Iv, Space Charge Limited Current, Poole-Frenkel, Schottky

All you need to do is put the directory of the top folder, and it will plot graphs of all the data in the folders
and sub-folders saving images of all the graphs as well.


The default values are as shown:

Area of device electrode <br />
area = 100E-6 <br />
Distance between electrodes (ie active layer height) <br />
distance = 100E-9 <br />


you also need too install all packages use pipenv install

### Graph Templates:

Please use the template provided as python places the data within the file in specific places however if you want to
edit the file you can do so however make sure you re-save as a cloanable template otherwise this wont work.
(note: for the graph to have the name of the work sheet this needs to be configured within the template)

NOTE: this is untested and will most likey not work with the current configuration 


### Future plans:

If you have any ideas of what to add please let me know, currently this is the next on my list

- Plot all graphs in one master file to see how the IV sweeps change over time. 

<br />
Cheers, Craig
